### Lab Preparation

* **How to use GitHub?**


* How to download C codes?

	
And here's some code! :+1:

```javascript
$(function(){
  $('div').html('I am a div.');
});
```

This is [on GitHub](https://github.com/jbt/markdown-editor) so let me know if I've b0rked it somewhere.


Props to Mr. Doob and his [code editor](http://mrdoob.com/projects/code-editor/), from which
the inspiration to this, and some handy implementation hints, came.

### Lab Evaluation
